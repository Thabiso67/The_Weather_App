SAWeather Application

BY Thabiso Thabethe ST10444690

I have developed a mobile Application called SaWeather. The Purpose of SaWeather is to help users with planning for their day by showing Temperatures for all areas of South Africa. 
Below are screenshots of the different screens and what they display:
